    \section{Introduction}

    Let $G = (V, E, w)$ be an undirected weighted graph (with non-negative weights). One can consider two natural metrics
    associated with $G$: let $d(v_1, v_2)$ be the distance between $v_1 \in V$ and $v_2 \in V$ with respect to $w$,
    and $\dunw(v_1, v_2)$~--- the distance between $v_1$ and $v_w$ with respect to unit weights.

    Let us pose the following problem.
    \begin{problem}
        Given an undirected weighted graph $G = (V, E, w)$ and $0 < \eps < 1$ let $U \subseteq V$ be \emph{an $\eps$-cover}
        of $G$ if for every $v_1, v_2 \in V$ such that $\dunw(v_1, v_2) \geq \eps n$ there exists $u \in U$
        such that $d(v_1, v_2) = d(v_1, u) + d(u, v_2)$.

        What is the smallest $\eps$-cover for a given graph $G$?
    \end{problem}

    In this paper we partially solve it and give two applications that use the existence of small $\eps$-covers.

    In Section~\ref{section_general_graphs} we prove two bounds. In Section~\ref{subsection_upper_bound}
    we prove that for every graph $G$ and $0 < \eps < 1$ there exists an $\eps$-cover of size $O(\log(1 / \eps) / \eps)$.
    It is an immediate consequence of the $\eps$-net theorem for set systems with bounded VC-dimension~\cite{HW86}
    and the fact that a system of shortest paths (provided that they are unique) has VC-dimension
    that is at most two~\cite{ADFGW11}.
    In Section~\ref{subsection_lower_bound} we prove that one can not improve the abovementioned bound
    to $O(1 / \eps)$ by a simple reduction to a deep theorem in additive combinatorics: density Hales--Jewett
    theorem~\cite{P09}. This technique is similar to that of Alon~\cite{A10}.
